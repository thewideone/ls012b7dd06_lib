# LS012B7DD06 driver library
Driver library for the LS012B7DD06 reflective LCD for ESP32 microcontrollers written in C using ESP-IDF API.
Note that this is only a driver. Example user code showing how to use this driver is at [this repo](https://github.com/thewideone/ls012b7dd06_esp32).
I have also written a driver for STM32 available [here](https://github.com/thewideone/ls012b7dd06_stm32_lib) with example user program [here](https://github.com/thewideone/ls012b7dd06_stm32).
